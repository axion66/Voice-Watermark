how the system works?



call makeAudio.py(need input text) to generate output.wav


call addWatermark.py(no need for inputs) to generate output_watermarked.wav from output.wav


later, call detectWatermark.py(need input for the audio file's path) to detect. if watermark is detected, returns "1", else "-1"




before running the code, please run "pip3 install -r requirement.txt" on the shell to install dependencies. Using virtual environment can prevent conflicts if you prefer.
